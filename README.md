Repository: Sentiment Analysis with EDA and Machine Learning
This repository showcases a comprehensive pipeline for Sentiment Analysis, combining the power of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

Features:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualizations and insights into the dataset's distribution.
Identification of missing values, imbalances, and other key trends.
Data Preprocessing:

Text cleaning, tokenization, and normalization.
Removal of noise, stopwords, and special characters for optimized processing.
Sentiment Analysis:

Implementation of TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) and Bag-of-Words techniques to extract meaningful features from text data.
Categorization of text into positive, negative, and neutral sentiments.
Model Evaluation:

Utilized various evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Comparative analysis of different machine learning models for better performance insights.
Key Technologies Used:
Python: Core programming language.
Pandas, NumPy: Data manipulation and preprocessing.
Matplotlib, Seaborn: Data visualization for EDA.
Scikit-learn: NLP feature extraction and machine learning models.
Purpose:
This project demonstrates a full-fledged sentiment analysis pipeline from raw data to actionable insights, focusing on practical implementation and clarity.
